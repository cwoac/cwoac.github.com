So, having just added support for the custom excerpt to the theme, I discover that literally [yesterday](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/commit/936ed1f849fe360523b846a346bf0b04d8503a04) jekyll added support for autogenerating excerpts.


Which is nice, but obviously it will be some time before that feature gets rolled out onto GitHub. I wonder what it will do to my existing excerpts then? Well, I guess we will find out when they suddenly change. 

Until then, this post shall remain resolutely excerpt-less
